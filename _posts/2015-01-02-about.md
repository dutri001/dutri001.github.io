<p class="about-text">
	Hi, I'm Lo√Øc, at the moment I am finishing <a href="https://www.wageningenur.nl/en/project/Spatio_temporal_data_analysis_for_monitoring_and_assessment_of_biodiversity_and_-forest_dynamics_in_tropical_South_America.htm">my PhD</a> where I try to combine forest ecology and remote sensing to tackle complex spatio temporal problems such as biodiversity mapping or monitoring of forest.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
	I'm passionate about <a href="https://github.com/dutri001">open source</a> (I developed some <a href="https://dutri001.github.io/bfastSpatial">projects</a> and I contribute regularly to the <a href="http://r-sig-geo.2731867.n2.nabble.com/">R-SIG-Geo mailing list</a>), and I like to build easy to use tools that help solving complex problems in an easy and elegant way. 
	I'm a quick self learner, interested in solving complex problem, and I thrive in interdisciplinary environments.

<p class="about-text">
	During my PhD, I taught, took part in an interdisciplinary and international research project, supervised students, and published <a href="https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=8ntQ0eMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">research papers</a>. Additionally, I sometimes I get to give <a href="http://www.loicdutrieux.com/talks/">talks</a> at workshops or conferences.
