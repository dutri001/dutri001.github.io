HI, I'm Lo√Øc, at the moment I am finishing [my PhD](https://www.wageningenur.nl/en/project/Spatio_temporal_data_analysis_for_monitoring_and_assessment_of_biodiversity_and_-forest_dynamics_in_tropical_South_America.htm) where I try to combine forest ecology and remote sensing to tackle complex spatio temporal problems such as biodiversity mapping or monitoring of forest dynamics. I am passionate about [open source](https://github.com/dutri001) (I developed some [projects](https://dutri001.github.io/bfastSpatial) and I am a regular contributor to the [R-geo mailing list](http://r-sig-geo.2731867.n2.nabble.com/)), and I like to build easy to use tools that help solving complex problems in an easy and elegant way. 
I am a quick self learner, interested in solving complex problem, and I thrive in interdisciplinary environments.
During my PhD, I taught, took part in a interdisciplinary and international research project, supervised students, and published [research papers](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=8ntQ0eMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Additionally, I sometimes I get to give [talks](http://www.loicdutrieux.com/talks/) at workshops or conferences.
If you are interested in knowing more about me, feel free to take a look at the map below, or at my [CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/github/repos/dutri001/CV/builds/latest/output.pdf).
